<h1 style="font-family:monotype corsiva;"><span style='font-size:40px;'> ONLINE LEARNING MOTIVATION </h1>

<p style="font-family:georgia;">The world is having a pandemic right now which is Covid-19 and most schools and universities are taking the approach to further their education by using online learning. 
	<br>There are a lot of pros and cons of online learning. The pros are the students are able to participate in the 
	learning sessions from any place while keeping their <br>social distance and  able to adhere to the MCO by not having to attend classes at the faculties. However, some 
	difficulties might occur among students which will hinder <br>them from accessing online learning such as limited internet coverage or unstable wifi connection.
<br>
<br>There is no specific method that will succeed for everyone in maintaining ongoing motivation.
However, there are plenty of choices that you can explore, to see if they work for you. 
<br>If they do, you need to implement them into your ongoing plan. If not, set them aside and try something else.
The main thing is that the plan keeps you focused, 
<br>not whether other people agree with you.
Below are a few tips and motivations on how to adapt with online learning that i have been practised.

<center><h2 style="font-family:monotype corsiva;"><span style='font-size:30px;'>1. To-Do-List</h2></center>

<p style="font-family:georgia;">Firstly, you need to list all the assignments and assestments that you need to do. It is because it is a lot more easier. Once you had done listed it, you can start the assignments which is the due is ealier than the others. After you have done the assigments, you can tick it so that you do not need to think about it anymore. You will be comortable when you see your works are decreasing.</center>
<p style="font-family:georgia;">Here is a quote from Atul Gawande, The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/6862414-the-checklist-manifesto-how-to-get-things-right">
<q style="font-family:verdana;"><i>Good checklists, on the other hand are precise. They are efficient, to the point, and easy to use even in the most difficult situations. They do not try to spell out everything--a checklist cannot fly a plane. Instead, they provide reminders of only the most critical and important steps--the ones that even the highly skilled professional using them could miss. Good checklists are, above all, practical.</q></i>

<center><h2 style="font-family:monotype corsiva;"><span style='font-size:30px;'>2. Ask your Friends and Lecturers</h2></center>

<p style="font-family:georgia;"> Not all of the students have a secure internet connection and if you miss an assignment or assessment, you can ask your friends and lecturers about it. I am sure they will understand. When I do not know how to do certain assignments, i will ask my friends about it and they would help without problem. Same goes with when i ask my lecturers about how to do the assigments, they will tell me and help me understand it better. With this method, you can feel a little relieve because even if you are alone, you can do it. Like a Malay proverb <q><i> Malu Bertanya, Sesat Jalan</q></i> which means if you do not try, you will not succeed.</p>

<br>

<center><h2 style="font-family:monotype corsiva;"><span style='font-size:30px;'>3. Don't Forget to Take a Break</h2></center>

<p style="font-family:georgia;">Don't be harsh to yourself. Take a break in between. After 1 hour of sitting at your desk, take a rest for 15 minutes. You can have a glass of fresh orange or maybe some coffee. You can also watch your favourite kdrama or kvariety. It will help you to not feel stress. As Merissa V. Grayson quote <q><i> Sometimes you have to take a break from the grind, clear your mind & enjoy some "me" time.</i></q> As for me, when i take a break, i usually scrolling media social such as Twitter, Instagram and Tiktok. I also streak with my friends at Snapchat. When you had done with your break, you may continue your work again. </p>

<br>

<center><h2 style="font-family:monotype corsiva;" class="solid"><span style='font-size:30px;'>4. Enjoy Yourself</h2>

<p style="font-family:georgia;">The definition of enjoy yourself is to get pleasure from and event or experience. It is important to enjoy yourself while doing your works. While you doing your work, you can enjoy it in many ways such as play songs from your favourite playlist or eating snacks. 
As Brandi Chastain said <q><i> Well there are two things: Number one is, make sure you always enjoy yourself, because when you enjoy yourself, you'll learn, you'll want more information, you'll push yourself.</i></q> When i do my works, i usually plays my favourites songs and enjoy myself. By doing this, i don't even realized that i had done my works. </p>

<center><h2 style="font-family:monotype corsiva;"><span style='font-size:30px;'>That is all from me. I hope you will get motivated by my tips or maybe you can find your own motivation that suit you. Thank you! <3</h2></center>
